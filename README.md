# Amnesia Interface Designer Software

This is a web-based tool attempting to represent how the inventory is laid out in Amnesia The Dark Descent. Ideally it will allow you to more quickly see the results of changes you do to the config file that sets up the inventory layout, and then copy the output config to your file.

I cannot guarantee that it is 100% identical since this is just an approximation of how different elements affect each other, so some edge cases where one file gets resized differently may be expected.
